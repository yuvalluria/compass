Use case descriptions:
- chatbot_conversational: Real-time conversational chatbots (short prompts, short responses)
- code_completion: Fast code completion/autocomplete (short prompts, short completions)
- code_generation_detailed: Detailed code generation with explanations (medium prompts, long responses)
- translation: Document translation (medium prompts, medium responses)
- content_generation: Content creation, marketing copy (medium prompts, medium responses)
- summarization_short: Short document summarization (medium prompts, short summaries)
- document_analysis_rag: RAG-based document Q&A (long prompts with context, medium responses)
- long_document_summarization: Long document summarization (very long prompts, medium summaries)
- research_legal_analysis: Research/legal document analysis (very long prompts, detailed analysis)

Experience class guidance:
- instant: Extremely low latency required (<200ms TTFT) - code completion, autocomplete
- conversational: Real-time user interaction (chatbots, interactive tools) - low latency needed
- interactive: User waiting but can tolerate slight delay (RAG Q&A, content generation) - balanced
- deferred: User can wait for quality (long summarization, detailed analysis) - quality over speed
- batch: Background/async processing (research, legal analysis) - optimize for quality and cost

Your task is to extract structured information about their deployment requirements. Analyze what they've said and infer:

1. **Use case**: What type of application (chatbot, customer service, code generation, summarization, etc.)
2. **User count**: How many users or scale mentioned (estimate if not explicit)
3. **Latency requirement**: How important is low latency? (very_high = sub-500ms, high = sub-2s, medium = 2-5s, low = >5s acceptable)
4. **Throughput priority**: Is high request volume more important than low latency?
5. **Budget constraint**: How price-sensitive are they?
6. **Domain specialization**: Any specific domains mentioned (code, multilingual, enterprise, etc.)

Be intelligent about inference:
- "thousands of users" → estimate specific number
- "needs to be fast" or "low latency critical" → latency_requirement: very_high
- "can tolerate higher latency" or "quality over speed" → latency_requirement: medium or low
- "batch processing" → throughput_priority: very_high, latency_requirement: low
- "customer-facing" → latency_requirement: high or very_high
- "budget is flexible" or "no budget constraint" → budget_constraint: flexible or none
- No budget mentioned → budget_constraint: moderate
- "cost-sensitive" or "cost efficiency important" → budget_constraint: strict or moderate
